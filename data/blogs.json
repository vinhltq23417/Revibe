      "Step 3: Check the Label. Before you buy, check the 'Sustainability Score' on ReVibe or look for materials like 'Reclaimed Wood' and 'Recycled Cotton'.",

      "Step 5: Be Kind to Yourself. You will forget your reusable bag. You will accidentally buy a plastic-wrapped item. It's okay. Sustainability is a journey, not a destination."

      "Is it really 'better'?",
      "In short: yes. Reclaimed wood is not only stronger and more durable (it has withstood the test of time), but it also possesses a unique character and patina that new wood simply cannot replicate. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the demand for virgin timber, helping to preserve our forests."
